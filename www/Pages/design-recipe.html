        <h1 id="design-recipe-example">Design Recipe Example</h1>

<p>In 0112, we’ll follow a structured approach to solving coding problems. Other courses call this sort of thing a “design recipe”, and we’ll follow suit. Of course, there are many different possible recipes! Think of this as guidance on getting started—we’ll say more in class, and add new ingredients to the recipe as they become necessary.</p>

<p>This document outlines the steps of our recipe, and gives an example of each. The starting point is always a problem statement. Here’s an example:</p>

<center>
Given a table that describes the number of annual views for a set of sports, return which sports have viewership exceeding a given threshold. 
</center>

<h3 id="step-1-what-shape-of-data-do-you-have-to-work-with">Step 1: What shape of data do you have to work with?</h3>

<p>Our input data arrives in tabular form:</p>

<p><em>Example Data: The Annual Number of Views for Common Sports</em></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Sport</th>
      <th>Annual Number of Views</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Basketball</td>
      <td>23</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Football</td>
      <td>51</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Golf</td>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Soccer</td>
      <td>64</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Looking at the table, we see four rows corresponding to four data entries, with the first column giving the name of a sport and the second column saying what the annual viewership was.</p>

<p>There are many ways to represent this sort of data. It might be given to us in a file, or appear on a webpage, or some other raw form. For now, suppose that the table would be given to us as a <em>list</em> of entries, and that each entry would itself be another <em>list</em>. In this case, each entry list contains the name of the sport and its associated annual number of views. Thus, the above table would be given to us in the following form:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>```python
sports_table = [entry1, entry2, entry3, entry4]
```
where
```python
entry1 = ["Basketball", 23]
entry2 = ["Football", 51]
entry3 = ["Golf", 5]
entry4 = ["Soccer", 64]
```
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point it is helpful to write down a few <em>examples of input data</em>. How can different inputs vary, and in what ways does the difference matter?</p>

<h3 id="step-2-what-queries-do-you-need-to-answer-ie-what-shapes-of-data-do-you-need-to-produce">Step 2: What queries do you need to answer? I.e., what shapes of data do you need to produce?</h3>

<p>We are asked to identify which sports have more than a certain number of views. We weren’t told exactly how to deliver the results, but a <em>list</em> of sports names might make sense.</p>

<p>In general, there might be many different queries to answer. Here we just have one.</p>

<p>Like with the input data, it can be helpful to record an example of corresponding output data. E.g.,</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"Football"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"Soccer"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>might be an output for particular threshold on the above input.</p>

<!-- 

TN moved, or deferred -- the intermediate structure point comes later, so this is more about classes.

### Step 3: Identify useful data types (i.e. classes and their attributes)

This step will look different depending on the nature of the task. Sometimes, _objects_ will make sense (we'll cover these later in the semester). But here, we don't need to add much Let's just commit to returning our output in the form of a list.


For one, there aren't other attributes we want to associate with the sports class besides the annual number of views. Also, the format of the provided data already links each sport to its associated annual number of views. Therefore, we can solve this problem with a function that takes in the data and algorithmically computes our solution.
-->

<h3 id="step-3-write-a-specification-for-the-function">Step 3: Write a specification for the function</h3>

<p>In words, not code, state the relationship between the function’s input and output. For example, you might write the following for our example function:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">find_sports</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sports_table</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">threshold</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="s">"""
    Input: 
      - sports_table: a list of data entries, where each data entry is a 2-element
        list containing a sport and its associated annual number of views
      - threshold: an integer representing the number of annual views that a
        particular sport must exceed for it to be included in the output
    Output: 
      - A list containing sports with annual number of views that each exceed
        the threshold
    """</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Putting a multi-line string like this at the start of a Python function is standard, and often called a <em>docstring</em> for the function. We might now also add some <em>type hints</em> to the function header, to help us keep track of what to expect:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">find_sports</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sports_table</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">threshold</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="p">...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="step-4-what-assumptions-does-the-function-need-to-make-about-the-data">Step 4: What assumptions does the function need to make about the data?</h3>

<p>We often make assumptions when we sketch a function. For instance, we’ve probably assumed so far that the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">threshold</code> is positive. If this is important for the operation of the function, we should explicitly check.</p>

<!--
It's important to test the edge cases of functions. We should account for cases where our function may malfunction to ensure that our function works with various inputs. For example, functions that take in numeric inputs and work differently depending on the range that number is in should test the boundaries of those ranges.

Our proposed function consumes two arguments: `sports_table` and `threshold`. Since we are not given any assumptions about the validity of our inputs, we can add checks to verify our inputs and raise exceptions when necessary.

For this example, let's ensure that each of our inputs is not null. Also, let's enforce threshold to be a positive value (since there is no such thing as a negative number of annual views).
-->

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">find_sports</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sports_table</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">threshold</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="s">"""
    Input: 
      - sports_table: a list of data entries, where each data entry is a list
        containing a sport and its associated annual number of views
      - threshold: an integer representing the number of annual views that a
        particular sport must exceed for it to be included in the output
    Output: 
      - A list containing sports with annual number of views that each exceed
        the threshold
      - If threshold is negative, throws a ValueError.
    """</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">threshold</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="nb">ValueError</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"ERROR: threshold must be non-negative."</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Python’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueError</code> nicely expresses the problem of a bad input value. Notice that we’ve added a new line to the specification, also, to communicate to anyone using this function what to expect if they give an invalid threshold.</p>

<p>There may be other unstated assumptions here, too, but this check illustrates the idea.</p>

<h3 id="step-5-additional-data-structures">Step 5: Additional Data Structures</h3>

<p>Consider whether your queries might be better answered if, in advance, you built up some helper data structures. When doing this, consider whether the <em>cost</em> of building the helper data is worth the expected <em>gain</em>.</p>

<p>Here’s an example. We could pre-compute, for any given threshold value, the list of sports our function should output. But without knowledge in advance of which thresholds we likely to see, it would be challenging to build this data in advance—at least, in a cost-effective way.</p>

<p>We’ll see some examples of good helper data structures in class soon.</p>

<!--
For functions, it is important to think about any intermediate data structures that may be necessary.

Since we will need to store and return the output in the form of a list, we could have our function initialize an empty list and subsequently populate that list with the appropriate sports.

```python
def find_sports(sports_table, threshold):
    """
    Input: 
      - sports_table: a list of data entries, where each data entry is a list
        containing a sport and its associated annual number of views
      - threshold: an integer representing the number of annual views that a
        particular sport must exceed for it to be included in the output
    Output: 
      - A list containing sports with annual number of views that each exceed
        the threshold
    """
    if not sports_table:
        raise Exception("ERROR: sports_table is not valid.")
    if not threshold or threshold < 0:
        raise Exception("ERROR: threshold is not valid.")

    sports = []
```
-->

<h3 id="step-6-code-but-not-all-at-once">Step 6: Code (but not all at once)</h3>

<p>It’s OK (and normal) to not immediately know how to tackle a problem. Instead, start from the top down, and slowly work your way toward a solution.</p>

<p>In this case, we know that we should return a list, and so it’s natural to create one as a helper data structure. We also need to check every row in the sports table we’ve been given, so we’ll add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code> loop.</p>

<!--
One possible approach would be to look at the annual number of views for each sport. If the annual number of views for a particular sport exceeds the threshold, we should store this sport in the data structure to be returned.
-->
