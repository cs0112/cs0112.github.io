# 'approx' is a pytest helper for working with floats. Because of
# the intricacies of float-point arithmetic in most languages,
# error can quickly become an issue, especially when multiplying.
#   (Recall why we use significant digits in science.)
# Per the docs, the default relative tolerance is 1e-6.

# Refer to this doc for details on how it works:
# https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/reference/reference.html#pytest-approx
